# challenge02

## Purpose
This website is my portfolio for the UCF Full Stack Boot Camp.  This website will house my top projects (once they are completed).

This website was challenge 02 of Winter 2021 UCF's Full Stack boot camp.  The purpose of this assigment was to add generate a HTML and CSS page from scratch.  The page layout was copied from a video demo presented in the assigment.  Flex box and CSS media was used to make the page responsive.
